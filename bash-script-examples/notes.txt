GENERAL

Scripts should start with #!/bin/bash (shebang).
But it is best practice to use #!/usr/bin/env bash.

Use chmod u+x to make the file executable for its owner.

Bash scripts run inside a non-interactive shell.
It is possible to change options for the subshell with "set" or "shopt" in the script.


QUOTES

Quotes have a different effect on interpretation of scripts.
Wrapping the following command with single quotes will make bash interpret it as a literal string:
'echo $(uname -r)'

However, using double quotes will allow bash to be reasonable about special characters while interpreting expansions correctly.


TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS

1. Read errors carefully
2. Observe line numbers in errors
	less -N myscript
3. Check quotes and escaping
	Single quotes and double quotes work differently
4. Check spacing in tests
	[[$a-gt3]] will fail but [[ $a -gt 3 ]] will work
5. Check closure of expansions and substitutions
6. Remember that commands and variables are case sensitive
7. Use set -x to display commands as they run
8. Use echo statements throughout the script
9. Use true and false built-ins to troubleshoot logic


SCRIPT PORTABILITY TIPS

1. Check the user's Bash version before running the script
	Old Linux systems and Macs tend to have outdated versions of Bash
	$BASH_VERSION and $BASH_VERSINFO contain version information
2. Check if the user has nonstandard tools your script uses
3. Sometimes, it's useful to write scripts that also work with Bourne Shell (sh) for broader compatibility
4. Keep your scripts clear, readable, and well-commented for yourself and others
5. Decide how portable your script needs to be

# vfplot Examples

This repository contains example plots and visualizations generated using `vfplot`, a vector field plotting tool. The examples demonstrate various data sources and rendering techniques, including potential flows, fluid dynamics simulations, and 3D rendering.

## Prerequisites

To run these examples and generate the plots, you will need the following software installed:

- **vfplot** (version 2.0 or later)
- **GMT** (Generic Mapping Tools, version 6.0 or later)
- **POV-Ray** (version 3.7 or later) - required for the `bvkp` example
- **Gerris Flow Solver** tools (`gfs-tools`, specifically `gfs-csv`) - required to extract data from `.gfs` simulation files
- **Python 3** - required for processing data in `bvk` and `bvkp`
- **Ghostscript** or **ImageMagick** - for converting output figures to PNG

## Examples Overview

Each subdirectory contains a self-contained example with its own `Makefile`.

| Directory | Description | Background |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bsnq` | **Boussinesq Flow**: Buoyancy-driven flow generated by a heated cylinder. | Temperature |
| `bvk` | **Born-von Karman Vortex Street**: Vortex sheet detachment in flow around a half-cylinder. | Vorticity |
| `bvkp` | **POV-Ray BVK**: A 3D POV-Ray rendering of the Born-von Karman vortex street setup. | N/A (3D Render) |
| `grating` | **Grating Flow**: Turbulent flow past a coarse grating. | Vorticity |
| `rotcyl` | **Rotating Cylinder**: Unstable flow around a halted, previously rapidly rotating cylinder. | Vorticity |
| `ljpot` | **Lennard-Jones Potential**: Visualization of the force field from a Lennard-Jones potential (used in `vfplot`'s ellipse placement). | N/A |
| `mhd` | **Magnetohydrodynamics**: Simulation illustrating the suppression of turbulence by shearing. | Divergence |

## Usage

You can build all examples by running `make` in the top-level directory:

```bash
make
```

Alternatively, you can build a specific example by navigating to its directory and running `make`:

```bash
cd bsnq
make
```

This will typically generate a `figure.pdf` and a `compose.png` visualization in the target directory.

## Credits

These examples utilize simulation data generously provided by:

- **A. P. L. Newton** (University of Sheffield) for the Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) data.
- **Paul Cardinaels** for the Rotating Cylinder `gerris` simulation data.
